# Snake

Super buggy, basic version of Snake as I remember it from the Nokia 6110.

Pretty much just a vehicle for trying my hand at writing something in C. I wanted to know what it's like doing memory management. 
I have a new appreciation for garbage collected languages after writing this!

## Get it working

1. `make`
2. `./snake`
