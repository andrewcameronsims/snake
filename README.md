# Snake

Super buggy, basic version of Snake as I remember it from the Nokia 6110.

Pretty much just a vehicle for trying my hand at writing something in C. I wanted to know what it's like doing memory management.
I have a new appreciation for garbage collected languages after writing this!

## Get it working

1. `make` to compile the binary
2. `./snake` to run it

## Controls

Use the arrow keys to move around, and q to quit.
Your goal is to eat as many apples as you can without hitting yourself or the edges of the screen.
